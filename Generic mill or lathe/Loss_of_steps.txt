I use an EMCO compact 5 CNC with MFI to edit and download.  During production of a 
series of products (using differ3ent tools in the turret), I noticed the parts becoming 
smaller each time.  It seemed I was losing 2 steps in X each run. Because it happened every run, 
it couldn't be a mechanical problem.

So I made some testprograms and measured the crosslide with a dial indicator.
In the listings below, I wrote down the actual readings.  If you copy the 
programs to MFI, you can see the positions where we should be. (Or calculate them yourself)

Within the step size of the crosslide stepper (and backlash in the measurement),
this program does what it is supposed to do. Begin en end position are the same.

Now with some tool changes, something goes wrong.
The 3rd tool 'sticks out' 1.00 mm further, so the reading after the first
change is about 100 less.

   Conclusion:
   After a toolchange, the Emco software makes rounding errors.
   Without a tool change, the programs behave as they should (within
   the accuracy of the steppers).  If you introduce a tool change, the 
   machine rounds off, and seem to forget that it did so. So when canging back to the 
   first tool, the rounding error is not compensated.
   
   I only tested this in Absolute Diameter mode.  I do not know if what 
   happens in Radius mode.  Maybe I'll find the time to try that out as well.

The Emco PC Mill 30 is actually a branded tool running Emcos own Basic CadCam software. It was introduced sometimes around 1994, and were sold only a few years before discontinued (1998?).

As with the other versions of Emco CadCam it requires MS-DOS operating system, but since it drives the mill through serial connection, which is less timing sensitive as a parallel connection - it may be possible to use it in DosBox emulated environment.

The mill was made by a French company "Multisoft Robotique". 

It was also sold under the brand names "Techsoft Camcut 300",  "Intelys f-1000" and "Jeulin 600" using other software. The CAM software "Galados" is listed as compatible to these other versions, but I dont know if Galados will work with the Emco version.

A USB version of the lathe is still marketed by Jeulin for about 4000 Euros:
